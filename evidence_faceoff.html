      </p>

      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        
        First up, it’s the recent Parler v. AWS matter, where Parler sued Amazon
        for refusing to continue to host the right-wing social media platform on
        AWS, after Parler users made thousands of shockingly violent posts after
        the January 6 Capitol insurrection. The Seattle Times had a nice
        <a
          class="text-blue-500 transition hover:text-white"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-can-keep-parler-offline-court-rules/"
          >summary</a
        >
        of the lawsuit and the hearing that preceded the order we’re about to
        unpack. But while the press focuses on the first amendment-y aspects of
        the case, Parler’s loss came down to the fact that they relied on
        dramatic allegations instead of cold, hard facts.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        Parler sued Amazon seeking a preliminary injunction that would force AWS
        to put Parler back online, ASAP. (For the non-lawyers in the house: a
        preliminary injunction means that Parler needed to prove to the court
        that it was decently likely to win on the merits once the case
        progressed further, so that the court should basically just give them
        what they want now without having to wait for the end of the lawsuit.)
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        First Up: The Sherman Act (Antitrust) claim:
        <br />
        Parler tried to argue the antitrust equivalent of “but mom, you let him
        do it!” Parler was claiming that Amazon allowed Twitter to get away with
        hosting similar violent content, and that Amazon’s actions with Parler
        were part of a nefarious plot to help Twitter succeed.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">Evidence faceoff:</p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parler didn’t submit any factual evidence that
        Amazon and Twitter conspired to get Parler out of the way in order to
        reduce Twitter’s competition. Womp womp.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Amazon submitted a sworn declaration
        by a high ranking Amazon executive who explicitly denied that Amazon and
        Twitter ever had a single conversation about Parler, and noted that to
        do so would violate Amazon’s policies of never sharing one customer’s
        information with another. He also emphasized his powerful executive role
        and said he never authorized anyone on his team to have this kind of
        conversation, so therefore it couldn’t have happened.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Amazon dunked on Parler with its evidence
        showing that technically, it didn’t even host Twitter yet. An executive
        stated in a declaration that the agreement to work with Twitter was
        signed in Dec 2020, but Twitter’s feed wasn’t yet on AWS. Amazon used
        this fact to argue that it didn’t even make sense to compare their
        relationship with Twitter.
      </p>

      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        Takeaways: Amazon had to prove a negative here–that they never discussed
        something internally. That’s a tough thing to prove when extensive
        discovery hasn’t yet occurred. They decided the quickest way to “prove”
        this was to have an exec explain the internal policy against discussing
        customer data, and swear that since he didn’t personally have or
        authorize anyone else to have convos with Twitter, it must not have
        happened. Is this airtight evidence? Nope. But since Parler submitted
        nothing, the court held it was good enough.
      </p>

      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        The argument about Twitter’s feed not yet being on AWS is a great
        example of using a technical piece of evidence to help the judge zoom
        out and see the practical realities of Amazon’s position. Amazon is
        explaining that while it has to take responsibility for content it hosts
        on its platform, Twitter isn’t up there just yet. At this particular
        moment in time, Parler is a (rotten) apple, while Twitter is an orange.
        Interestingly, having made this argument, once Twitter’s feed is live on
        AWS, Amazon better be able to show evidence that it’s treating Twitter
        the same re: shutting them down for failure to moderate violent content.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">Next up: The Contract claim:</p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">Evidence Faceoff:</p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon and Parler each claim that the other
        company violated the terms of the AWS contract. The judge’s ruling here
        came down to one simple fact–that Parler simply didn’t deny Amazon’s
        argument that Parler’s content violated the agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parler tried to focus on a contract
        technicality, that Amazon needed to notify them and give them 30 days to
        fix any issues with the violent hate speech.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the judge wasn’t hearing it because Parler
        didn’t even bother to argue or submit evidence showing that the violent
        content wasn’t in violation.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        Takeaway: Again, Parler whiffed it by simply not providing any evidence
        to contradict Amazon’s argument about the content violating the
        contract. Amazon’s strategy was simple and powerful–show the court
        examples of the horrific, violent content Parler allowed on its
        platform. How could Parler have engaged more with this evidence? Perhaps
        they could have at least tried to analyze for the court a selection of
        the troubling posts, highlight any gray areas in whether they should be
        removed, and give a specific discussion of the timeline of how and when
        such posts would have been taken down. And as a side note, I wonder
        whether their counsel didn’t want to be seen as supporting violent
        extremists by making this argument and implicitly debating the merits of
        these violent posts.
      </p>

      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        It all added up to a lack of facts in the record that would support a
        court forcing Amazon to host this violent content. This opinion is a
        pretty classic example of why litigants need to give the court something
        substantive to back up their lofty arguments, like documents or
        declarations with sworn testimony. This is especially important when
        seeking a preliminary injunction (which has a seriously high bar before
        a judge will grant one–the case hasn’t run the usual course yet).
      </p>

      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        And the case also shows that before discovery, when the parties can’t
        supply the court with lots of emails and texts they found to support
        their claims, a tightly worded declaration by a company executive can be
        pretty powerful evidence.
