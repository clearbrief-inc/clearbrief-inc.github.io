        Every litigator recognizes that punch to the stomach when you finish
        reading the closing sentences of opposing counsel's brief, or an
        unfavorable order you're set to appeal. The tightening of your neck
        muscles; the outrage coupled with a tinge of pure, white-hot panic at
        the sheer enormity of the task before you--to respond to arguments that
        (in your eyes) have obviously misconstrued the truth, but suddenly seem
        disturbingly persuasive. As lawyers, we see the chaos tangled in the
        complex, technical prose. We process it. We identify the cracks in the
        logic, the missing parts of our client's story. And our herculean task
        is to shape a formal, rigid pleading into prose that changes hearts and
        minds.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        The best appellate writer I know keeps a John Cage quote framed in her
        office and placed strategically within eyesight from her desk: "Begin
        anywhere." Begin anywhere, because the act of starting to write is the
        only thing that will shake the doubt and the dust off of you. Let the
        flow of formulating sentences to the rhythm of your clicking keyboard
        remind you that you’re a powerful advocate, and your words have the
        power to change things.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        Early in my career as a state Assistant Attorney General, the first job
        where I regularly had to draft a high volume of legal briefs on my own,
        a cloud of crushing deadlines lurked over my desk. I would meet the
        moment of starting to write with so much uncertainty: following
        exhaustive research trails, reading over legal brief templates by my
        colleagues, highlighting an absurd amount of quotations, as if enough
        fluorescent yellow passages would light my path to an outline. I would
        take a break only to return to my screen and re-read what I’d written,
        aghast at how amateurish my words sounded.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        And yet, as I hammered those first briefs into existence, I remember the
        surprising joy of the blank-page freedom to speak directly to a powerful
        judge, to challenge the court to see things differently. Accustomed to
        the impatient pace of law school and workplace discussion, I frankly
        wasn't used to having a forum to craft and share my views, uninterrupted
        and at a thoughtful pace. That may be part of the reason I've always
        loved the legal writing process. It feels like a rare, sacred space to
        create an elegant expression of logic and reason. A place to share an
        authoritative explanation of the truth, each assertion backed by
        concrete legal authority. When you've read enough all-caps arguments in
        the Facebook comments, you gain an unholy appreciation for the value of
        citations.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        And I now realize that the most seasoned litigator, judge, law clerk,
        opposing counsel, the in-house attorney--we all face that moment when we
        begin to write. A moment where we're humbled by the responsibility and
        trust placed in us, questioning whether our theory of the case has
        unseen holes, suspecting that our effort is futile in a judicial system
        with so many punishing hoops and trap doors. But we have a special kind
        of courage--we know that we have to begin somewhere; to forge something
        out of nothing. And yes, the first draft is always a rough draft.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        In founding ClearBrief, I'm reminded of that moment. We’re building a
        legal technology company, but we’re also building a community around the
        creativity and craft of excellent legal writing. Our goal as
        technologists is to provide you with modern (and even fun!) tech that
        enhances your writing flow, and reduces the many stressful tasks
        associated with litigation.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        But modernizing litigation is not just about tech--it’s about
        collectively sharing our insights from the trenches. So much of what we
        learn as attorneys over the years is unspoken, nuanced, and kept hidden
        behind a strict veil of professionalism (and somehow, stubbornly, mounds
        of paper in accordion files), preventing newcomers from understanding
        the path to success in this work. By sharing a glimpse of the writing
        process from a wide variety of legal writers, we believe ClearBrief can
        create a space for innovation.
      </p>
      <p class="p-4 leading-relaxed">
        If you'd like to join our growing community of attorneys interested in
        exploring what it means to modernize litigation and the legal writing
        process, I invite you to sign up
        <a target="_blank" href="./signup.html" class="text-blue-500">here.</a> You'll receive
        an invitation for early access to our private beta tools that simplify
        the tasks associated with filing a brief, and you’ll stay in the loop as
        ClearBrief grow. Let’s begin, together.
